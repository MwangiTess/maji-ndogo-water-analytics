# Maji Ndogo Water Infrastructure and Budget Allocation Report

This project provides comprehensive insights into water infrastructure improvements and budget allocation across the Maji Ndogo national water system. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators for water access initiatives in five provinces (Akatsi, Amarzi, Hawassa, Kilimani, and Sokoto).It contains a set of interactive Power BI dashboards designed to analyze and monitor the national and regional effectiveness of water infrastructure improvements and budget allocation for the **Maji Ndogo Water Survey**.

The reports provide critical insights into service gaps, spending efficiency, and the impact of various improvement efforts across different provinces (like Sokoto) and location types (Rural/Urban).

## Key Insights and Features

* **Regional Performance Overview:** The main national dashboard offers a high-level comparison of population, improvements, and budget across provinces (Akatsi, Amanzi, Hawassa, Kilimani, Sokoto).
* **Budget Allocation Analysis:** Provides a detailed breakdown of how allocated funds (\$40M for Sokoto, \$147M National Total) are distributed across different infrastructure types (e.g., Drill well, RO filter, Public taps).
* **Improvement Effectiveness:** Visuals display the quantity of completed improvements, allowing for comparison between different intervention types and their respective costs.
* **Rural vs. Urban Disparity:** A dedicated chart analyzes spending and population to highlight disparities in resource distribution between rural and urban areas.
* **Interactive Toggle Functionality:** The reports feature a user-controlled toggle (Province/Improvement) to dynamically switch the central visual's context, optimizing space and user experience.

## Technical Details

* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* **Focus:** Data modeling, report design, advanced bookmarking for navigation and visual toggling.
* **Goal:** To provide stakeholders with a clear, data-driven view of investment returns and remaining water access challenges.
